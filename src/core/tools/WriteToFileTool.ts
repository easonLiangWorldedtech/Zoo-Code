	 * Per-task partial-streaming state, keyed by task id (taskId + instanceId).

	 * resetPartialState() cannot clear a subset of them and leak the rest (abort
	 * listener, failure mark, path-stabilization entry) for an abandoned stream.
	 *
	 * This deliberately diverges from the sibling streaming tools (ApplyDiffTool,
	 * EditFileTool, SearchReplaceTool, EditTool), which rely on BaseTool's singleton
	 * lastSeenPartialPath / resetPartialState and keep no failure state. The divergence is
	 * intentional, for two reasons:
	 *
	 * 1. Only this tool's handlePartial performs failure-prone streaming work
	 *    (diffViewProvider.open/update, which can throw EACCES/EROFS); the siblings only
	 *    send a task.ask preview. Without per-task failure tracking, every later delta for
	 *    a failed path would re-attempt the failing operation and re-spawn a partial tool
	 *    message.
	 *
	 * 2. The tool instance is a module-level singleton shared by every task, including
	 *    tasks from different ClineProvider instances (e.g. sidebar and tab-panel
	 *    providers, which activate independently). A single provider streams at most one
	 *    task at a time — TaskScheduler gates task.run() at maxConcurrency=1 and
	 *    delegation disposes the parent before the child starts — so per-task keying is
	 *    reachable specifically across providers, where two providers can stream
	 *    write_to_file concurrently through this same singleton.
	 *
	 * Lifting this per-task keying into BaseTool for all streaming tools is a follow-up
	 * (separate PR); it is deliberately not done here.
