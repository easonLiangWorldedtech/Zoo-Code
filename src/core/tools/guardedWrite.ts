 * Guarded-write compare-and-swap core (upstream epic #1375, phase A4a).

 *
 * - an unobserved target may only be created when it is absent
 *   (createIfAbsent);
 * - an observed target is published only when the on-disk version token still
 *   matches the token recorded at read time (replaceIfVersion);
 * - an edit-style write requires a prior observation (unobservedEditGuard).
 *
 * A per-absolute-path FIFO chain of tail promises orders concurrent
 * in-process writes to the same path: the first matching write wins, the rest
 * fail stale. Observations come from the task's S2 ObservationRegistry.
