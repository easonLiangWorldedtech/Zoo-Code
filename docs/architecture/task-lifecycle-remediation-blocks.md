# Task lifecycle remediation blocks

## One story point in this report

One story point (1 SP) is a small, independently reviewable **modeling or documentation increment**, not a time estimate. A 1-SP block owns one bounded behavior or property and must include:

- an explicit production symbol or boundary mapping;
- one model/checker change when a faithful model boundary exists, otherwise an explicit reason no checker is appropriate;
- focused test or CI evidence references;
- objective acceptance criteria and declared exclusions.

Completing one block does not close its `LIFE-GAP` unless the parent GAP closure criteria are also satisfied. Blocks may depend on shared primitives or earlier evidence, so story-point size does not imply scheduling independence.

## Ownership rules

- Every `LIFE-GAP-001` through `LIFE-GAP-038` has exactly one primary block below.
- A block owns exactly one GAP ID. Dependencies may reference other blocks but do not duplicate ownership.
- Block IDs are stable: `LIFE-BLK-P<workstream>-<gap number>`.
- Baseline blocks describe current serial production behavior. Optional fan-out is isolated under `FANOUT-BLK-*` and does not own a baseline `LIFE-GAP`.
- Each block is documentation/formal-model scope. Runtime work named in acceptance criteria belongs in a later implementation PR.

## Mechanical coverage check

The primary tables above map the closed integer range `001..038` exactly once. Reviewers should verify this mechanically before changing the register:

```sh
rg -o '^\| LIFE-BLK-P[0-9]-[0-9]{3} \|' docs/architecture/task-lifecycle-remediation-blocks.md \
  | sort \
  | uniq -d
```

The command must print nothing. It matches only primary table rows, so dependency references and optional `FANOUT-BLK-*` rows are excluded.

Separately compare block suffixes with the GAP column to detect omissions or mismatches:

```sh
node -e 'const fs=require("fs");const s=fs.readFileSync("docs/architecture/task-lifecycle-remediation-blocks.md","utf8");const rows=[...s.matchAll(/^\| LIFE-BLK-P\d-(\d{3}) \| (\d{3}) \|/gm)];const gaps=rows.map(r=>r[2]);const want=Array.from({length:38},(_,i)=>String(i+1).padStart(3,"0"));if(rows.length!==38||rows.some(r=>r[1]!==r[2])||want.some(id=>!gaps.includes(id)))process.exit(1)'
```

## Block completion template

- [ ] Stable block and parent GAP IDs are in the PR description.
- [ ] One bounded behavior/property and its exclusions are stated.
- [ ] Production symbols and ownership boundary are linked.
- [ ] Model/checker change is included, or non-applicability is justified.
- [ ] Focused test, E2E, and CI evidence requirements are explicit.
- [ ] Actions/landmarks remain reachable; bounds cannot truncate silently.
- [ ] Completion does not overstate parent GAP closure.
- [ ] Dependencies are satisfied or carried as explicit blockers.
